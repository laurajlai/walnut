# Shadow Akari from personAFTB. Fighting her with a full party of Xuanqiang (MC), Yixue, Shengyong, and Luna, with Azu serving as Teddie/navigator/emergency food.  
# Akari deals Fire damage and has no weaknesses, but is strong against Fire (Agi) moves and physical moves are less effective against her.
# The main mechanic of this boss is Abduction - the ability to insta-kill a player character marked with the UFO. She can Abduct characters multiple times, but only one UFO can be on field at any moment.
# If Xuanqiang is downed, the game ends.
